# PUSH - Black Hole - WebGL Experiment

## Concept
This tiny WebGL experiment arose from experimenting with vertex shaders in WebGL trying to achieve transparency through geometry, ending up with a black hole :) Move the mouse around to play with the black hole.

## Tech
The snippet was built in Javascript, using the Three.js framework.
